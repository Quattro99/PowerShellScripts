# Recomended EOP / MDO standard settings of Microsoft

The primary functionality of the script is to automatically deploy standard Microsoft best-practice settings for EOP and MDO to a customer's Microsoft 365 tenant. These settings enhance email security and protection against threats.
The script performs a series of actions, including creating and configuring Safe Links and Safe Attachments policies, setting up anti-phishing policies, configuring MDO settings for Microsoft 365 apps, defining spam and malware filter policies, adjusting sharing policies, enabling audit logs, disabling IMAP and POP access, and blocking client forwarding rules. Finally, it disconnects from the Exchange Online session.
This script is a valuable tool for administrators tasked with securing an Microsoft 365 environment efficiently and in line with recommended security practices.

With this script you can deploy the standard settings to a customer tenant: [xxx-standard-auto-mdo_eop.ps1](https://github.com/Quattro99/PowerShellScripts/blob/6b7a612432729f86e163a7094f971042d02e387d/Exchange%20Online/EOP_MDO/xxx-standard-auto-mdo_eop.ps1)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### enableorgcustomization-function
Checks the tenant if the organization customization is activated. If not, the customisation will be activated

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### defaultsharingpermission-function
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some values have to be changed before running the script. Please check if the sharing permission name is German or English.

This function sets the default sharing permissons of all calendars to "FreeBusySimple". 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### adminauditlog-function

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### createsharedmailbox-function
This function creates a shared mailbox. This mailbox is later configured for the quarantine messages to each employee.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### antiphishingpolicy-function (EOP anti-phishing policy settings)
In PowerShell, you use the [New-AntiPhishPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-antiphishpolicy) and [Set-AntiPhishRule](/powershell/module/exchange/set-antiphishrule) cmdlets for anti-phising policy & rules settings.



### antispampolicy-function (EOP anti-spam policy settings)

In PowerShell, you use the [New-HostedContentFilterPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/new-hostedcontentfilterpolicy) and [Set-HostedContentFilterRule](/powershell/module/exchange/set-hostedcontentfilterrule) cmdlets for anti-spam policy & rules settings.


Wherever you select **Quarantine message** as the action for a spam filter verdict, a **Select quarantine policy** box is available. Quarantine policies define what users are able to do to quarantined messages, and whether users receive quarantine notifications. 
If you _change_ the action of a spam filtering verdict to **Quarantine message** when you create anti-spam policies the Defender portal, the **Select quarantine policy** box is blank by default. A blank value means the default quarantine policy for that spam filtering verdict is used. These default quarantine policies enforce the historical capabilities for the spam filter verdict that quarantined the message. When you later view or edit the anti-spam policy settings, the quarantine policy name is shown.
Admins can create or use quarantine policies with more restrictive or less restrictive capabilities.

#### EOP outbound spam policy settings

To create and configure outbound spam policies, see [Configure outbound spam filtering in EOP](outbound-spam-policies-configure.md).

For more information about the default sending limits in the service, see [Sending limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#sending-limits-1).

> [!NOTE]
> Outbound spam policies are not part of Standard or Strict preset security policies. The **Standard** and **Strict** values indicate our **recommended** values in the default outbound spam policy or custom outbound spam policies that you create.
