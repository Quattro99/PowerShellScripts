# Recomended EOP / MDO standard settings of Microsoft

The primary functionality of the script is to automatically deploy standard Microsoft best-practice settings for EOP and MDO to a customer's Microsoft 365 tenant. These settings enhance email security and protection against threats.
The script performs a series of actions, including creating and configuring Safe Links and Safe Attachments policies, setting up anti-phishing policies, configuring MDO settings for Microsoft 365 apps, defining spam and malware filter policies, adjusting sharing policies, enabling audit logs, disabling IMAP and POP access, and blocking client forwarding rules. Finally, it disconnects from the Exchange Online session.
This script is a valuable tool for administrators tasked with securing an Microsoft 365 environment efficiently and in line with recommended security practices.

With this script you can deploy the standard settings to a customer tenant: https://github.com/Quattro99/PowerShellScripts/blob/6b7a612432729f86e163a7094f971042d02e387d/Exchange%20Online/EOP_MDO/xxx-standard-auto-mdo_eop.ps1

### EOP anti-malware policy settings

Quarantine policies define what users are able to do to quarantined messages, and whether users receive quarantine notifications. The policy named AdminOnlyAccessPolicy enforces the historical capabilities for messages that were quarantined as malware. Users can't release their own messages that were quarantined as malware, regardless of how the quarantine policy is configured. If the policy allows users to release their own quarantined messages, users are instead allowed to _request_ the release of their quarantined malware messages.
